## Current Issue - IN PROGRESS ⚠️

### **Game Over UI Setup - Button Hookup Problem**

**Status:** Game Over Panel created, but RestartButton not hooking up to GameManager.RestartGame() function

**What's Been Created:**
- ✅ GameOverPanel created (child of Canvas)
- ✅ GameOverPanel disabled in Inspector
- ✅ WinnerText (TextMeshPro) created as child
- ✅ RestartButton created as child

**What's NOT Working:**
- ❌ RestartButton → On Click() → Cannot find GameManager.RestartGame() in dropdown
- The dropdown shows "No Function" and "MonoScript" instead of "GameManager"

**Scripts Updated:**
- ✅ GameManager.cs has Game Over functionality added (lines 3, 12, 19-20, 30, 48-50, 59, 82-107, 116-158)
- ✅ `RestartGame()` function exists and is public
- ✅ `LoadMainMenu()` function exists and is public
- ✅ `EndGame(string winner)` function added
- ✅ Win condition logic added (first to 5 points)
- ✅ Game state tracking (`gameOver` bool)

**What Still Needs to Be Done:**
1. **Fix Button Hookup:**
   - Try closing/reopening Unity to force recompile
   - Check Console for any compile errors
   - Manually link RestartButton to GameManager.RestartGame()

2. **Link GameManager References:**
   - Drag GameOverPanel to GameManager's `gameOverPanel` field
   - Drag WinnerText to GameManager's `winnerText` field
   - Set `scoreToWin` to 5 (or desired value)

3. **Test Game Over Flow:**
   - Play game until someone scores 5 points
   - Verify Game Over panel appears
   - Verify winner text shows correctly
   - Click Restart button to test scene reload

## Troubleshooting Steps to Try Next Session

### **If Button Still Won't Hook Up:**

**Option 1: Force Unity Recompile**
1. Close Unity completely
2. Reopen project
3. Wait for full compile (watch bottom-right spinner)
4. Try button setup again

**Option 2: Check for Errors**
1. Open Console tab
2. Clear all messages
3. Look for RED compile errors
4. Fix any errors found

**Option 3: Manual Setup**
1. Select RestartButton
2. On Click() → Click + button
3. Click the circle icon (⊙) next to object field
4. Select "Scene" tab in popup
5. Choose GameManager
6. Click Function dropdown → GameManager → RestartGame()

**Option 4: Verify Script Attachment**
1. Select GameManager GameObject
2. Check Inspector shows "GameManager (Script)" component
3. If missing, re-add the script

## What's Left to Implement

### **Not Started:**
- ❌ Game Over Panel fully functional (in progress)
- ❌ Main Menu scene
- ❌ Parallax background layers
- ❌ Custom graphics for paddles and ball (art files exist in Assets/Art/)
- ❌ Particle effects for collisions
- ❌ Audio clips assignment (files exist in Assets/Audio/)

### **Optional Enhancements (Future):**
- Power-ups system
- Two-player mode
- Difficulty settings
- Combo system
- Pause menu

## File Locations

### **Scripts (All Exist and Working):**
- `Assets/Scripts/Ball.cs` - ✅ Working (with debug logs currently active)
- `Assets/Scripts/PlayerPaddle.cs` - ✅ Working
- `Assets/Scripts/AIPaddle.cs` - ✅ Working
- `Assets/Scripts/GameManager.cs` - ✅ Updated with Game Over functionality
- `Assets/Scripts/CameraShake.cs` - ✅ Working

### **Assets:**
- `Assets/Audio/` - Sound files available but not assigned
  - Fail.wav
  - Paddle Hit.wav
  - Success.wav
  - Wall Hit.wav
- `Assets/Art/` - Graphics available but not used yet

## GameManager.cs - Current State

**New Additions:**
```csharp
// Added using statement
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

// New public variables
public int scoreToWin = 5;
public GameObject gameOverPanel;
public TextMeshProUGUI winnerText;

// New private variable
private bool gameOver = false;

// New functions
void EndGame(string winner) { ... }
public void RestartGame() { ... }
public void LoadMainMenu() { ... }
```

**Modified Functions:**
- `Start()` - Hides game over panel on start
- `Update()` - Stops checking scores when gameOver = true
- `PlayerScored()` - Checks for win condition
- `AIScored()` - Checks for win condition

---

## Quick Start Guide for Next Session

1. **Open Unity** and load PaulPong project
2. **Check Console** for any errors
3. **Try button hookup again:**
   - Select RestartButton
   - On Click() → Add GameManager → RestartGame()
4. **Link Game Over references in GameManager:**
   - gameOverPanel → GameOverPanel
   - winnerText → WinnerText
   - scoreToWin → 5
5. **Test the game:**
   - Play until someone scores 5 points
   - Verify Game Over screen appears
   - Test Restart button

## Known Issues & Fixes

### **Issue 1: Ball Physics Wonky** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Ball stopped on paddle impact and floated upward
**Cause:** Physics material friction/bounciness settings incorrect
**Fix:** Set Bouncy material to Friction: 0, Bounciness: 1

### **Issue 2: Ball Trail Too Wide** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Trail was twice the ball width
**Cause:** Trail Renderer width set too high
**Fix:** Set Width curve from 0.15 → 0

### **Issue 3: GameManager Can't Find Ball** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** NullReferenceException in GameManager.Start()
**Cause:** Ball wasn't tagged properly
**Fix:** Created "Ball" tag and applied to Ball GameObject, added null checks

### **Issue 4: RestartButton Won't Hook Up** ⚠️ IN PROGRESS
**Problem:** GameManager.RestartGame() doesn't appear in button dropdown
**Possible Causes:**
- Unity hasn't compiled the script
- Script not properly attached to GameObject
- Unity UI cache issue
**Next Steps:** Try solutions listed in Troubleshooting section above

## Testing Checklist

Before considering Game Over complete, test:
- [ ] Can play full game (ball bounces, scores update)
- [ ] Game ends when score reaches 5
- [ ] Correct winner message displays ("PAUL WINS!" or "AI WINS!")
- [ ] Ball stops moving when game ends
- [ ] Game Over panel appears
- [ ] Restart button reloads the scene
- [ ] Scores reset to 0-0 after restart
- [ ] Game Over panel hidden on fresh start

---

## Debug Mode Active

**Ball.cs currently has debug logging enabled:**
- Lines 58, 63, 95, 99 have Debug.Log() statements
- These can be removed once Game Over is fully tested
- Logs show: collision detection, velocity values, hit detection

**To Remove Debug Logs Later:**
Search Ball.cs for `Debug.Log` and delete or comment out those lines.

## Next Major Milestones

1. **Complete Game Over UI** (current focus)
2. **Add Audio Clips** (files ready, just need assignment)
3. **Implement Custom Graphics** (replace sprites with .aseprite art)
4. **Create Main Menu Scene** (referenced in LoadMainMenu but doesn't exist yet)
5. **Add Parallax Backgrounds** (visual polish)
6. **Particle Effects** (collision feedback)

---

**Resume Point:** Fix RestartButton hookup to GameManager.RestartGame() function, then test full Game Over flow.
